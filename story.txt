Long ago in a distand land, our Kophkino story begins.
So there I was, listening to Rammstein in the flughafen.
Then some dude walks up to me wearing nothing but lederhosen!
He was eating a bratwurst chewing with his mouth open and i told him he looks ridiculous.
We then went to the Biergarten and started listening to musik. 
He asked me if I knew how to fix klimaanlage, and if I could repair his for free.
"Work for free?" I asked, "What a luftschloss, I wouldn't dream of it! What's in it for me?"
Tell you what, If you do this for me, I will give you a free Schnapsidee, bet you don't have enough of those
I looked at him strangley and said "yes I do!, for example, yesterday I thought of putting rocket engines on a bmw".
Suddenly, I became aware of the fact that I was standing in the middle of the hauptstrasse wearing a dirndel.
He told me he needed to go to the Ratskeller and left immediately  
But not before handing me a loaf of brot and telling me that I was needed in Berlin.
